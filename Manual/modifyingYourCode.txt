When using Fiftree, your code needs to be formatted under some specific rules to ensure that no errors pop up. So what do you need to do?

1. Include Paths

Your code might look like this:
```
#include "printfunction.h"

int main(){
    printfunction("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

But due to files moving and other factors, this include path wont. But how to fix that?
Assuming your `fiftree.txt`/`fiftree.ftr` files looks like this:
```
main
CPP

main.cpp
printfunction.h
```
(for writing an FTR file, please check "writingAnFTRfile.txt".)
You would need to update your path to
`#include "../lib/prinfunction.h"`

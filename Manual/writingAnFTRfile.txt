How do you write the content inside an FTR file? Its really simple actually, you just have to understand some basics and you are ready to build your fantastic projects!
Here are the following steps, line by line:

1. First line
In the first line, you can write what you want your binary's name to be
For example, if you are on Windows and write "output" in your first line, the binary coming out will be `output.exe`

2. Second line
In the second line, you write with what language you are going to compile, and it can either be C or C++ (providing that you use `gcc` or `g++`)
For example, if you are going to compile in C, you write "C" in the second line. Otherwise, you write "CPP"

3. Third Line
In the third line, you write nothing. Its the line that splits the Fiftree script in 2 parts, the necessary and the files

4. Comments
You can add comments in your Fiftree script using ';'. For example:
```
; this is a comment
```

5. Unwanted Files
If you want a file to move to a directory named "Unwanted" you just put "UW_" in the start of their name

6. Microsoft Files
Same with Unwanted Files, but they move to the directory "Microsoft" and you put "MS_" in the start of their name

7. More than one file to compile
You simply put `STC_` in the start of the name, which means `Source To Compile`. The main source that will be compiled and needs to exist is either `main.cpp` or `main.c`

8. Files
For any other file, for example `.py`, `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.c`, `.h` or `.hpp`, you just write their name and extension and they will be placed in the directory needed

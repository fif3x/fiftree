Well done! You downloaded Fiftree, but now what?

Before using it for the first time, you have to follow some steps

1. Setting up the Environmental Variables

To do that, you need to firstly ensure you have downloaded the right verison of the binary. You can also compile the code yourself, if you want

Then, on your PATH Environmental Variables, create a new one and set it as the path to the `fiftree.exe` file.

Now, you can succesfully use the command `fiftree {argument}` through the terminal!

2. Writing a fiftree script

(Read writingAnFTRfile.txt)

3. Running the command

After following all steps, all you have to do is type `fiftree {filename}.ftr`/`fiftree {filename}.txt` in your terminal!
If you have followed the guidelines correctly, your project will be completed! You can find your binary in `projectfolder/bin/`
